                           CPU09RAM card memory test.


The UniFLEX card is tested on the CPU09CMI running 16Mhz.
The RAM card need’s jumper J2 (select C4 Ext decode) 
and the CMI card need’s jumper J6 for this.

RDSKtst.s1  – Will show the switch setting.
              The first run will check if all pages are unique.
              The second one will write all 0000 to the ram, 
              you can change the 0000 at $0142.
              The third one will write all FFFF to the ram, 
              you can change the FFFF at $0157.

RBRdsk.s1  – Is a rotating bit memory test.

They both start at $0100.



Any RDSKtst.s1  Error looks like:
		Read  chip: 012
		Error at:
		WRITE READ PAGE Chip
		0803  0800 0003 U6
		Read  chip: 34567

Any RBRdsk.s1  Error looks like:
		Error at: 48CB ECAA

48CB is the address stored at $ED00 and $ED01.
ECAA is the address in the RAM space EC00-EDFF. 


24-24-2024 Due to a minor bug fix on the Rev 0.9.1 RAM card, the selection of Hi/Lo byte addresses has been changed.
           Memory testing has been adopted for this fix and is now running on the Rev 0.9.1 and Rev 0.9.5 cards.

02-05-2024 Added RAM card is present test, at least one DIPswitch must be ON.

06-05-2024 I put the ram disk test software on the "Virtual9.SSSD80-5.IMA".

           RAMDSK  .CMD - Runs in FLEX and will only run the page check.
           RBRDSK  .CMD - Runs in FLEX.
           RDSKTST .CMD - Runs in the CMI_SBUG monitor and runs 3 passes: page check, $0000 and $FFFF check.
           RBRDSKM .CMD - Runs in the CMI_SBUG.

           The CMI_SBUG programs loads from FLEX and will stop in the Monitor (ctrl-P CD03, G to return in FLEX).
           The memory test software will destroy the VDISK, so do firt a 'SET <' to unload the driver.
