                           CPU09RAM card memory test.


The UniFLEX card is tested on the CPU09CMI running 16Mhz.
The RAM card need’s jumper J2 (select C4 Ext decode) 
and the CMI card need’s jumper J6 for this.

RDSKtst.s1  – Will show the switch setting.
              The first run will check if all pages are unique.
              The second one will write all 0000 to the ram, 
              you can change the 0000 at $0130.
              The third one will write all FFFF to the ram, 
              you can change the FFFF at $0145.

RBRdsk.s1  – Is a rotating bit memory test.

They both start at $0100.



Any RDSKtst.s1  Error looks like:
		Read  chip: 012
		Error at:
		WRITE READ PAGE Chip
		0B07  0B00 0307 U6
		Read  chip: 34567

Any RBRdsk.s1  Error looks like:
		Error at: CB48 ECAA

CB48 is the address stored at $ED00 and $ED01.
ECAA is the address in the RAM space EC00-EDFF.
