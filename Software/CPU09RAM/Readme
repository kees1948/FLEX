                           CPU09RAM card.


The UniFLEX CPU09RAM card is tested on the CPU09CMI running 16Mhz.
The RAM card need’s jumper J2 (select C4 Ext decode) 
and the CMI card need’s jumper J6 for this.
Read "CPU09RAM card memory test".


Added a large GoTek image "VBackup.ima" and an new "IMG.cfg".
Added "Virtual9.SSSD80-5.IMA" with "virtual.cmd" a Virtual ram disk driver 
and "vdisk.cmd" the format program.
Read "Virtual".

On the "Virtual9.SSSD80-5.IMA" you also find "newBdisk.cmd" to (re)format the "VBackup.ima".
The "VBackup.ima" is bootable.
Formating the "VBackup.ima" wil take some time.

    SW2-1,  OFF 
    SW2-2,  OFF 
    SW2-3,  OFF
    SW2-4,  ON = FLEX 512 byte pages

    SW1-2,  OFF
    SW1-3,  OFF
    SW1-4,  OFF
