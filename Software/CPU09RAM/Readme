                           CPU09RAM card.


The UniFLEX CPU09RAM card is tested on the CPU09CMI running 16Mhz.
The RAM card need’s jumper J2 (select C4 Ext decode) 
and the CMI card need’s jumper J6 for this.
Put the test software on the "Virtual9.SSSD80-5.IMA" disk.
Read "CPU09RAM card memory test".


Added a large GoTek image "VBackup.ima" and an new "IMG.cfg".
Added "Virtual9.SSSD80-5.IMA" with "virtual.cmd" a Virtual ram disk driver 
and "vdisk.cmd" the format program.
Read "Virtual".

On the "Virtual9.SSSD80-5.IMA" you also find "newBdisk.cmd" to (re)format the "VBackup.ima".
The "VBackup.ima" is bootable.
Formating the "VBackup.ima" wil take some time.

If you not have a GoTek use the virtual.s1 en vdisk.s1.
Open on FLEX:
+++EDIT 1.virtual
   NEW FILE
       1.00=
              SEND virtual.s1 with TeraTerm
      63.00=S9C100
      64.00=#
   #S
+++

Run on FLEX:
+++S1FLEX 1.virtual 1.virtual.cmd

Do the same for vdisk.s1 and you ready to use the ram disk.


With the dip-switches SW-1 you can select the VDISK size, only one should be ON !!!

At present the dip-switches have the following assigments:

    SW2-4,  OFF 
    SW2-3,  OFF 
    SW2-2,  OFF
    SW2-1,  ON = FLEX 512 byte pages, card present flag.

    SW1-4,  ON = FLEX 4MB disk
    SW1-3,  ON = FLEX 8" DSDD
    SW1-2,  ON = FLEX 5" DSDD
    SW1-1,  OFF
