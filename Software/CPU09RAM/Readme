                           CPU09RAM card.


The UniFLEX CPU09RAM card is tested on the CPU09CMI running 16Mhz.
The RAM card need’s jumper J2 (select C4 Ext decode) 
and the CMI card need’s jumper J6 for this.

We use the UniFLEX GAL, the software split the 512 bytes 2 times 256 byte/sector !

Put the test software on the "Virtual9.SSSD80-5.IMA" disk.
Read "CPU09RAM card memory test".


Added a large GoTek image "VBackup.ima" and an new "IMG.cfg".
Added "Virtual9.SSSD80-5.IMA" with "virtual.cmd" a Virtual ram disk driver 
and "vdisk.cmd" the format program.
Read "Virtual".

On the "Virtual9.SSSD80-5.IMA" you also find "newBdisk.cmd" to (re)format the "VBackup.ima".
The "VBackup.ima" is bootable.
Formating the "VBackup.ima" wil take some time.

If you not have a GoTek use the virtual.s1 en vdisk.s1.
Open on FLEX:
+++EDIT 1.virtual
   NEW FILE
       1.00=
              SEND virtual.s1 with TeraTerm
      63.00=S9C100
      64.00=#
   #S
+++

Run on FLEX:
+++S1FLEX 1.virtual 1.virtual.cmd

Do the same for vdisk.s1 and you ready to use the ram disk.


With the dip-switches SW-1 you can select the VDISK size, only one should be ON !!!

At present the dip-switches have the following assigments:

    SW2-4,  OFF
    SW2-3,  ON = Reserve room for disk cache (SW1-4 must be OFF). 
    SW2-2,  ON = Try for 2 virtual drives if SW1-3 or SW1-2 is ON. 
    SW2-1,  ON = FLEX 512 byte pages, card present flag.

    SW1-4,  ON = FLEX 4MB disk
    SW1-3,  ON = FLEX 8" DSDD
    SW1-2,  ON = FLEX 5" DSDD
    SW1-1,  OFF



06-05-2024 Resolved a bug in virtual driver.
15-05-2024 Moved the software location.
           Added SWITCH test for disk cache.
           SW2-3 and SW1-4 ON will give a ERROR.
21-05-2024 Rearrange SW2, start option for 2 virtual drives.
25-05-2024 VIRTUAL & VDISK can make two 8" DSDD or two 5" DSDD virtual drives.
           There maybe bugs.
15-07-2024 VIRTUAL Version 9.4 works also with the IDE driver.
           On the IDE driver the switch SW2-2 will be ignored, only a V0 drive.

Remarks:
        Always use VIRTUAL & VDISK with the same version number.
