Slowly I am getting there. 

With FLEX4UniFLEX I started creating FLEX disks on 3.5 inch. Another step
was writing a 2 sector boot again for the CPUXXCMI environment.

In the mean time I have ported SBUG to the CPUXXCMI environment too, I believe
I did it well amd modified the 5" boot code so it can handle a CPU09FLX and 09FLP
combo. The CPU09FLX has been very minimalistic populated and need a few wires on it.

I wrote the serial IO drivers for FLEX on the CMI_SBUG and write diskdrivers
that may be capable of handling 3.5, 5 1/4 and 8" formats in single and double
denisty in a mix without any user intervention. I have not been able to test 
all things completely.

The result is: I have a FLEX 3.5" master disk that boots from the CMI_SBUG ROM.

The system has 60 KByte of RAM, FLEX sits on it's usual area from 
CD00-DFFF with small extra drivers in the E200 area.

It s the first step, new insights will change things without doubt.

My aim is to re-create the formatter from the 80's which could handle all
formats of disks.

I wrote 2 formatters, one for 5" compatible formats and one for the 8" disk
formats. Creating one formatter that fits all is too complicated and not worth
the effort.
