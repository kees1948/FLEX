     A working FLEX2 for the CPU02CMI (FLEX2.SSSD80-5.IMA).
     FLEX2.SYS = FLEX2.COR + cmi_io2a.bin
     Use a straight FD cable.
     The empty 'BootName' images SSSD have a bootloader.
     Tested with drive 0 and 1.

     Redo the bootloaders for DSSD.
     The diskdrivers are for 35, 40, 80 track SSSD.

     Add XBABIC to the images.
     Correct some data in Drivers.

     Oops forgot to put two pointers in the files 
     back to their original address.
     So everything through the assembler again.
     So now the correct versions.
     



Note:
    FLEX2 and FLEX3 COR are assembled for the cmi_68_4 MONITOR stack.
    BASIC.CMD and XBASIC.CMD are patched for the cmi_68_4 MONITOR.
