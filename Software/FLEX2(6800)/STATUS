     A working FLEX2 for the CPU02CMI (FLEX2.SSSD80-5.IMA).
     FLEX2.SYS = FLEX2.COR + cmi_io2a.bin
     Use a straight FD cable.
     The empty 'BootName' images SSSD have a bootloader.
     Tested with drive 0 and 1.

     A working FLEX3 for the CPU02CMI (FLEX3.SSSD80-5.IMA).
     FLEX3.SYS = FLEX3.COR + cmi_io3a.bin
     Use a straight FD cable.
     The empty 'BootName' images SSSD have a bootloader.
     Tested with drive 0 and 1.

     Redo the bootloaders for DSSD.
     The diskdrivers are for 35, 40, 80 track SSSD.

     Add XBABIC to the images.
     Correct some data in Drivers.

     Oops forgot to put two pointers in the files 
     back to their original address.
     So everything through the assembler again.
     So now the correct versions.

     Add DSSD diskdrivers, also on the images.

        APPEND FLEX2.COR CMI_IO2B.BIN FLEX2B.SYS
        LINK FLEX2B.SYS

        APPEND FLEX3.COR CMI_IO3B.BIN FLEX3B.SYS
        LINK FLEX3B.SYS

     Can BOOT now from DSSD images.
     The FLEX ima images boot now from FLEXxB.SYS
     Deleted the LINK.CMD from the ima's, it is not working.
     The B version diskdrivers are for 35, 40, 80 track SSSD and DSSD.

2025-04-13 CdeJ
     Add working LINK.CMD

2025-04-20 CdeJ
     Add beta diskdriver CMI_IO2T.BIN and CMI_IO3T.BIN
     also on the iamges FLEXxT.SYS
     They use all the functions as in the FLEX9 driver. 
     Works on all drive formats.
     For 8" double dens replace xtal by 10MHz.
     Add new bootloader "boot02".

2025-09-11 CdeJ
     The CPU02CMI with a 12MHz xtal will work fine in the monitor
     and running FLEX2 but some programs like BASIC and XBASIC not.
     Solved this problem!

2025-09-22 CdeJ
     New CMI_IO3A, CMI_IO3B and CMI_IO3T driver.
     New bootloader 'boot02DD' will boot on all formats but,
     FLEXxA,FLEXxB will only boot and work with 5" SSSD and DSSD.

2025-09-25 CdeJ
     New bootloader 'boot02DA' and faster sector read 'boot02AD'.
     Both boot on sb68-2k6 and sb68-4k6 monitor.
     For now only tested on 3MHz bus.

 BUG: You can boot and run FLEXxT from all the SSSD en DSSD formats.
      The SDDD and DSDD formats will boot FLEXxT 
      but after +++ prompt it hangs (beta diskdriver).
     

Test fase:     
     FORMAT 5", 8" for all the formats.
     

Notes:
    FLEX2 and FLEX3 COR are assembled for the cmi_68_4 and up MONITOR stack.
    BASIC.CMD and XBASIC.CMD are patched for the cmi_68_4 and up MONITOR.

    You can also APPEND and LINK the 6800 FLEX running on FLEX9.
    The images of the 6800-FLEX and 6809-FLEX are compatible,
    only the BOOTLOADERs are different.
