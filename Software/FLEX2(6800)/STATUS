     A working FLEX2 for the CPU02CMI (FLEX2.SSSD80-5.IMA).
     FLEX2.SYS = FLEX2.COR + cmi_io2a.bin
     Use a straight FD cable.
     The empty 'BootName' images SSSD have a bootloader.
     Tested with drive 0 and 1.

     A working FLEX3 for the CPU02CMI (FLEX3.SSSD80-5.IMA).
     FLEX3.SYS = FLEX3.COR + cmi_io3a.bin
     Use a straight FD cable.
     The empty 'BootName' images SSSD have a bootloader.
     Tested with drive 0 and 1.

     Redo the bootloaders for DSSD.
     The diskdrivers are for 35, 40, 80 track SSSD.

     Add XBABIC to the images.
     Correct some data in Drivers.

     Oops forgot to put two pointers in the files 
     back to their original address.
     So everything through the assembler again.
     So now the correct versions.

     Add DSSD diskdrivers, also on the images.

        APPEND FLEX2.COR CMI_IO2B.BIN FLEX2B.SYS
        LINK FLEX2B.SYS

        APPEND FLEX3.COR CMI_IO3B.BIN FLEX3B.SYS
        LINK FLEX3B.SYS

     Can BOOT now from DSSD images.
     The FLEX ima images boot now from FLEXxB.SYS
     Deleted the LINK.CMD from the ima's, it is not working.
     The B version diskdrivers are for 35, 40, 80 track SSSD and DSSD.

2025-04-13 CdeJ
     Add working LINK.CMD

Test fase:
     FORMAT 5", 8" for all the formats.
     Diskdriver for 5" en 8" all formats and cable select function,
     the driver can already read all the formats.



Note:
    FLEX2 and FLEX3 COR are assembled for the cmi_68_4 MONITOR stack.
    BASIC.CMD and XBASIC.CMD are patched for the cmi_68_4 MONITOR.

    You can also APPEND and LINK the 6800 FLEX running on FLEX9.
    The images of the 6800-FLEX and 6809-FLEX are compatible,
    only the BOOTLOADERs are different.
