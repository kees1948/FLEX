How to bring up FLEX 6809 on your CPUXXCMI system  (with 68X09/63X09 CPU present)

Here are a few FLEX software parts in .S1 format. This allows for to bring a FLEX
system up on the CPUXXCMI hardware basically from scratch.

It is assumed that you have, at least a 3.5/5.25 inch drive and a 3.5/5.25" floppy 
disk available. One extra diskette should be blank or the contents are not vital.
Best is to have 2 disk drives.

These disk drives should be connected to the 09FLP disk hardware board and the 
selects on both drives should be '1', provided that the floppy cable has the 
famous IBM wire swap in the cable. Drive 0 is the one on the farthest end.

Via the serial communication line adn the 'L' function of the SBUG version for
the CPUXXCMI card, one can download the flex.sys.s1 file first.

From sbug you can set the PC with ^P to CD00, 'G' will then activate FLEX,
the date setting will fail. With 'MON' you get back from FLEX into SBUG.
This FLEX version supports a multitude of disk formats.{*}

Use the 'L' function again to download one of the newdisk versions, choose
the one that suits best for disk and drives. When the download is complete,
start this program at 0100, follow the questions and format a disk, afterwards
you will return to FLEX.

Copy over the files from your 'other' FLEX disk to the new one, keep in mind
that you still needs to replace the flex.sys file with the one from this page.

This could be done with the 'save.low' program after a fresh (re) download
of flex.sys.s1. Save all from C700 up to E15F, start address CD00. 

BEWARE, in this directory these are 6809 code programs!!!

Bring save.low into memory with 'GET' but don't start it only after the 
download of flex.sys.s1 has been completed. save.low starts at 0100.
