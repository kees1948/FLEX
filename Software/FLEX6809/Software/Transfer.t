                     TRANSFER


Transfer files between FLEX9/MSDOS with MSDOS.

Tranfer files from (MINIFLEX) FLEX1 to FLEX9 with minFLEX.


The software works on all the cmi_io4 versions.
And will test for the cable type, PC or Straigt, so best to use cmisbug3.


The software is on the TransferIt.DSDD80-5.IMA GoTek image, no FLEX on it.

Also there are 4 MSDOS GoTek images to test MSDOS on GoTek MSDOS images,
you have to update the GoTek IMG.CFG file for this.




Note:
    All 5 images and IMG.CFG are in TransferIt.zip
    This software is still under construction.
    But you can use it.
