                          BUILD a FLEX.SYS


Here are a few FLEX software parts in .S1 format. This allows for to bring a FLEX
system up on the CPUXXCMI hardware basically from scratch.

It is assumed that you have, at least a 3.5/5.25 inch drive and a 3.5/5.25" floppy 
disk or a GoTek unit available.
One extra diskette or GoTek IMA should be blank or the contents are not vital.
Best is to have 2 disk drives.

These disk drives should be connected to the 09FLP disk hardware board and the 
selects on both drives should be '1', provided that the floppy cable has the 
famous IBM wire swap in the cable. Drive 0 is the one on the farthest end.
When using a straigth cable drives should be '0' and '1'.

Via the serial communication line and the 'L' function of the SBUG version for
the CPUXXCMI card, one can download the flex3cor.s1 file first.
Depending on the CMI_SBUG version 1.0, 1.1 or 1.3 and up
download one of cmi_io2.s1, cmi_io4.s1, cmi_io4x.s1, cmi_io4A.s1 or cmi_io4B.s1
or any newer one.
ignore >C what? at the end.

From sbug you can set the PC with ^P to CD00, 'G' will then activate FLEX.
With 'MON' you get back from FLEX into SBUG.
This FLEX version supports a multitude of disk formats.{*}

Use the 'L' function again to download one of the newdisk or format versions,
choose the one that suits best for disk and drives. 
When the download is complete, start this program at 0100, 
follow the questions and format a disk, afterwards you will return to FLEX.

Copy over the files from your 'other' FLEX disk to the new one, keep in mind
that you still needs to replace the flex.sys file with the one from this page.

Use the 'L' function again to download S1FLEX.S1 return to FLEX and
+++SAVE,S1FLEX.CMD,0000,1547,0000

Now we can build a new FLEX:
  On Windows use Tera Term v4.106.
   Set baud rate 9600, Transmit Delay: char 1 msec and line 15 msec

  On FLEX
   +++EDIT FLEX3COR.S1
   NEWFILE
          1.00= 

  (now on Tera Term Send FLEX3COR.S1)
  Wait until S1 sending stops (will take a few minutes)
  Enter #
  #S

  +++ EDIT {CMI_IO2.S1 | CMI_IO4.S1 | CMI_IO4X.S1 | CMI_IO4A.S1 | CMI_IO4B.S1}
  NEWFILE
          1.00= 

  (now on Tera Term Send the cmi_io.s1 you used before)
  Wait until S1 sending stops (will take a few minutes)
  Enter #
  #S

  +++S1FLEX FLEX3COR.S1,FLEX3.COR
  +++S1FLEX CMI_IOx.S1,CMI_IOx.BIN,D370,E153 (the cmi_io.s1 from before)

     use FLEX2DRV.SYS - CMI_IO2
         FLEX4DRV.SYS - CMI_IO4
         FLEXCMI.SYS  - CMI_IO4X
         FLEXCMI.SYS  - CMI_IO4A or CMI_IO4B

  +++APPEND FLEX3.COR,CMI_IOx.BIN,FLEXxxx.SYS
  +++LINK FLEXxxx.SYS

Now try to BOOT from this drive.


For the NEWDISK/FORMAT and CMISTEP programs, 
download those via the serial communication line into EDIT
and save them.

+++ EDIT {FORMAT5.S1 | FORMAT8.S1 | CMISTEP.S1}
  NEWFILE
          1.00= 

  (now on Tera Term Send the files.s1)
  Wait until S1 sending stops (will take a few minutes)
  Enter #
  #S

Now convert them with S1FLEX.CMD.
+++S1FLEX FORMAT5.S1 ,FORMAT5.CMD
+++S1FLEX FORMAT8.S1 ,FORMAT8.CMD
+++S1FLEX CMISTEP.S1 ,CMISTEP.CMD



{*} 
5" 10 sectors/track (SD)
5" 18 sectors/track (DD)
8" 15 sectors/track (SD)
8" 26 sectors/track (DD)

All formats are supported in in SS and DS. And where DD is active
track 0 has the proper # of sectors in SD.

    FORMAT5, FORMAT8, CMISTEP new versions support al the drivers.
