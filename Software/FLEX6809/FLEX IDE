                 FLEX with IDE driver

      This is the SD card software from PERIPHERAL TECHNOLOGY.
      Michael Evenson rewrote it for the CPU09IDE card 
      using the FLEXCMI.SYS version.
      With tips from CS, I rewrote the READ and WRITE routines.
      This gives roughly a 12-20% better performance.
      I also split the file FLEXCMIx into 3 main parts:
           FLEXCOR , {device}BOOT and CMI_IDE.



         This FLEX version consists of 3 main parts.

1: FLEXxCOR.BIN is the FLEX.COR for use with IDE driver
2: FLPBOOT.TXT is the drive descriptor for booting from a floppy disk
3: IDEBOOT.TXT is the drive description for booting from an IDE device
4: CMI_IDE.BIN is the ide/flp driver

If you want to change the disk format
you can edit and assemble the IDEBOOT.TXT and/or FLPBOOT.TXT

Building FLEX.SYS
  
   BOOT on FLP

       +++APPEND FLEXxCOR.BIN FLPBOOT.BIN CMI_IDE.BIN FLEXFLP.SYS

or BOOT on SD

       +++APPEND FLEXxCOR.BIN IDEBOOT.BIN CMI_IDE.BIN FLEXIDE.SYS

     Use 'idefmt.cmd' to format the IDE partions.
     Don't forget to link the file with 'cmilink.cmd'.



Remarks:
     I have already included the GoTek FLEX......IMA files with this software 
     and the rewritten utilities for it.
