                 FLEX with IDE driver

      This is the SD card software from PERIPHERAL TECHNOLOGY.
      Michael Evenson rewrote it for the CPU09IDE card 
      using the FLEXCMI.SYS version.
      With tips from CS, I rewrote the READ and WRITE routines.
      This gives roughly a 12-20% better performance.
      I also split the file FLEXCMIx into 3 main parts:
           FLEXCOR , {device}BOOT and CMI_IDE2.



         This FLEX version consists of 3 main parts.

1: FLEXxCOR.BIN is the FLEX.COR for use with IDE driver
2: FLPBOOT.TXT is the drive descriptor for booting from a floppy disk
3: IDEBOOT.TXT is the drive description for booting from an IDE device
4: CMI_IDE3.BIN is the ide/flp driver

If you want to change the disk format
you can edit and assemble the IDEBOOT.TXT and/or FLPBOOT.TXT

Building FLEX.SYS
  
   BOOT on FLP

       +++APPEND FLEXxCOR.BIN FLPBOOT.BIN CMI_IDE3.BIN FLEXFLP.SYS

or BOOT on SD

       +++APPEND FLEXxCOR.BIN IDEBOOT.BIN CMI_IDE3.BIN FLEXIDE.SYS

     Use 'idefmt.cmd' to format the IDE partions.
     Don't forget to link the file with 'cmilink.cmd'.

2024-08-05
     Added 'plist.cmd' to add info about the partitions,
     plist will use sector-1.
     So 'idefmt.cmd' and 'cmilink.cmd' will now use sector-0 for the BOOT.
     This BOOT loader will also check for the correct MONITOR.

     CMI_IDE3.BIN cleanup/speedup IDE calls.

     Release version 6 monitor and drivers.
             +++APPEND FLEXxCOR.BIN FLPBOOT.BIN CMI_IDE6.BIN FLX6FLP.SYS
             +++APPEND FLEXxCOR.BIN IDEBOOT.BIN CMI_IDE6.BIN FLX6IDE.SYS

     Added FLEX3.01 commands MKDIR and CHD, put on BOOT drive.
     Use with RAM card with UPS backup as 4MB work drive,
     copy some Gotek source images in directories on it.
     Saves a lot of time, not having to scan the USB stick for the sources.



Remarks:
     The latest CMISBUG5 monitor will boot an IDE first from sector-0 
     if not found then from sector-1 or sector-1 and sector-2.
     If you don't use 'plist', the old versions will still work.
     I have already included the GoTek FLEX......IMA files with this software 
     and the rewritten utilities for it.

     The CMISBUG6 monitor with CMI_IO6B / CMI_IDE6 will be IO independent.
