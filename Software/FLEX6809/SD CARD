The SD card image contains partition 0 and 1.

Partition 0
   is the boot partition.
   This partition also contains files with the extension DIR,
   these belong to the HELP program.

Partition 1
   is a copy of 0.
   Plus the date of all the IMA's in sub DIR's (CHD 1.subdirname, CHD 1./).

   SDimage now boots on IO independent version.
   Cleaned up old CMI drivers and FLEX.SYS versions, 
   also in subdirectories on P1.

2025-09-01
   Update the software in the .DIR's on partition-1 with the latest data.
   Added MONITOR9.DIR AND DRIVERS9.DIR with last sources.
   Added FLEX2.DIR, FLEX3.DIR, MONITOR2.DIR and DRIVERS2.DIR for 6802.

Info:
   When you use Linux to put the SDimage on a SD card, 
   the dd command will say 'transferred 64MB', 
   if it is not 64MB you use the wrong adaptor/SDcard combination.

   For a 32MB or 64MB 'Kingston Micro SD HC I' card use a SD35VC0 converter.
   For a 8GB or 32GB 'microdrive SD Smart' card use a TF35VA0 converter.

   With the 'microdrive SD Smart' card in a SD35VC0 converter 
   the Linux dd command will say 'transferred 32MB'.
   See the DISK_TYPES table in the UniFLEX section!

   Oh yes you don't have a correct converter for the SD card, 
   then use a hard disk.


Note:
   I use MKDIR and CHD commands on my virtual disk
   and that works perfectly, system power off/on, boot other FLEX, change CPU card.
   The virtual drive is intact and all software can be used.

   So from all the IMA's the data was put in subdirectories on partition 1.

.  The BASIC.DIR and HELPFILE.DIR are not subdirectories, 
   they belong to the HELP program.

   The 16MB FLEX partition is in bytes, the real SD size is 32MB per partition.
   So use for dd count=131076 for P0 + P1.
