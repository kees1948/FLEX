The SD card image contains partition 0 and 1.

Partition 0
   is the boot partition.
   This partition also contains files with the extension DIR,
   these belong to the HELP program.

Partition 1
   is a copy of 0.


Note:
   I use MKDIR and CHD commands on my virtual disk
   and that works perfectly, system power off/on, boot other FLEX, change CPU card.
   The virtual drive is intact and all software can be used.

   So I thought to create on partition 1 of the SD DIRs for all the data of all the images.
   And that also works perfectly on this SD card.

   But if I now make an image of this SD card with dd on Linux 
   and restore it to a new SD card with dd, 
   all these DIRs are empty and all programs after the last created DIR hang the system.

   So be careful with these 2 commands on a SD partition.
