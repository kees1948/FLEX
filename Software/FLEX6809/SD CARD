The SD card image contains partition 0 and 1.

Partition 0
   is the boot partition.
   This partition also contains files with the extension DIR,
   these belong to the HELP program.

Partition 1
   is a copy of 0.
   Plus the date of all the IMA's in sub DIR's (CHD 1.subdirname, CHD 1./).


Note:
   I use MKDIR and CHD commands on my virtual disk
   and that works perfectly, system power off/on, boot other FLEX, change CPU card.
   The virtual drive is intact and all software can be used.

   So from all the IMA's the data was put in subdirectories on partition 1.

.  The BASIC.DIR and HELPFILE.DIR are not subdirectories, 
   they belong to the HELP program.

   The 16MB FLEX partition is in bytes, the real SD size is 32MB per partition.
   So use DD count=131076 for P0 + P1.
