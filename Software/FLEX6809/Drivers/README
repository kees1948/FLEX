The CMISTEP program changes in memory some driver settings.
It checks the driver version and boot cable used and determines what you can change.

For driver 1, 2 and 3 it can change the step rate for all the drives.
For driver 4 it can change the step rate for each drive.
For driver 5 it can change the step rate and set double step for each drive.
For driver 6 it can change the step rate and set double step for each floppy drive.
