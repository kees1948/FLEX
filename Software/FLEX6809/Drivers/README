                  Driver info and CMISTEP


   Driver     - Use

 1. cmi_io2.t  - PC-cable use ‘cmi_sbug’ 

 2. cmi_io4.t  - Straight-cable use  ‘cmisbug1’ 

 3. cmi_io4x.t - Cable independent use ‘cmisbug3’ 

 4. cmi_io4A.t - Cable independent use ‘cmisbug3’ for a slow drive

 5. cmi_io4B.t - Cable independent use ‘cmisbug3’ read 40 track disk in 80 track drive

 6. cmi_ide.t  - cmi_io4B.t + ide driver

 7. cmi_ide2.t - cmi_io4B.t + ide driver

 8. cmi_ide3.t - cmi_io4B.t + ide driver, spead/clean up IDE calls

 9. cmi_io6B.t - cmi_io4B.t but IO independent on cmisbug6

10. cmi_ide6.t - cmi_ide3.t but IO independent on cmisbug6



The CMISTEP program changes in memory some driver settings.
It checks the driver version and boot cable used and determines what you can change.

For driver 1, 2 and 3 it can change the step rate for all the drives.
For driver 4 it can change the step rate for each drive.
For driver 5 it can change the step rate and set double step for each drive.
For driver 6 it can change the step rate and set double step for each floppy drive.
For driver 7 it can change the step rate and set double step for each floppy drive.
For driver 8 it can change the step rate and set double step for each floppy drive.
For driver 9,10 it can change the step rate and set double step for each floppy drive.


       Drivers 1-8 memory layout

  $DE00 - $E0FF < diskdriver part
  $E100 - $E1FF < Floppy read/write part
  $E200 - $E2FF < IDE driver part


       Drivers 9,10 memory layout

  $DE00 - $DFFF < diskdriver part-1
  $E400 - $E4FF < diskdriver part-2
  $E500 - $E5FF < Floppy read/write part
  $E600 - $E6FF < IDE driver part, cmi_ide6 only

  The SD card needs a new bootloader.
  You can use DPACH to put BOOTSECT.HEX on sector 0
  or format the SD card with IDEFMT version 6.0
