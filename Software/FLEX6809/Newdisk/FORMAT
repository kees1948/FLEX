Update format5, format8 to work with all the disk drivers and on the 16MHz card.
The old FORMATx programs are not working with the IDE disk driver.
There are now a Logical and a Physical drive number.

Rewrite the source from UniFLEX relasmb to FLEX ASMB.
You also need the files 'flpdata.h', 'sysconf.t', 'sectab.t' to ASMB.

Note:
    When 'VIRTUAL' is loaded the format only works when de Floppy disk number
    match the entry number.

    +++SET
    0=H0 S
    1=H1
    2=D2    < D2 match the entry 2
    3=V0 w
            format will work on drive number 2.
    
    Not if you use the SET command to change the drives locations.

    +++SET 3=D2 2=V0
    0=H0 S
    1=H1
    2=V0 
    3=D2 w  < D2 not match the entry 3
            format will NOT work on drive number 3

    If you boot from Floppy and virtual give this setting:
    +++virtual
    0=D0 SW
    1=V0
    2=H0
    3=H1

    You can swap in floppy drive 1.
    +++set 1=D1
    0=D0 SW
    1=D1    < D1 match entry
    2=H0
    3=H1
            format will work on drive number 1.
    And swap V0 back, +++SET 1=V0
