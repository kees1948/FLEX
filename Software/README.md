Here are the software parts for the CPU09 FLEX system.

I am working on both a 6809 FLEX version and a 6800 FLEX version.

In the CPUXXCMI folder you may find the (adapted) monitor ROM
files. 

In the FLEX6809 folder there are files that allow you to bring up
your FLEX9 system.

In the FLEX2(6800) folder will come the files that allow you to 
bring up your FLEX2 system
