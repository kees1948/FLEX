Files in 'PC cable BOOT' can boot on that cable when using cmi_sbug version 1.0
Files in 'FLEX cable BOOT' can boot on a straight cable using cmi_sbug version 1.1
All images will boot on  cmi_sbug version 1.3

If you have a GotTek with 'FlashFloppy' your lucky 
   you can boot and run FLEX + HIER with one of the following.

'PC cable BOOT' also have a HIER2DRV.DSDD80-5.IMA and HIER2DRV.DSDD77-8.IMA, 
   ready to boot and run HIER2DRV.SYS
   Jumper both drives as 1 and MOT on.

'FLEX cable BOOT' also have a HIER4DRV.DSDD80-5.IMA and HIER4DRV.DSDD77-8.IMA, 
   ready to boot and run HIER4DRV.SYS
   Jumper the drives as 0, 1, 2 and MOT on.

If you are on cmi_sbug version 1.3 you can use from 'FLEX cable BOOT' the
HIERCMI.DSDD80-5.IMA or HIERCMI.DSDD77-8.IMA to boot and run HIERXCMI.SYS

All the BOOT images contains the HIER 'MANUAL.TXT', read it.
Always use 'HOME drvnr' when using another floppy or IMA in drive 1, 2 or 3
To backup a hierarchical floppy with the 'BACKUP.CMD' you will need 3 drives.
 
To use any IMA copy it to the USB stick together with the files 
in 'GoTek config files'.
You can rename the IMA part 'BootName' in a disk name. 




Note:
    The FLEX3.COR and FLEX301.COR are different.
    	  FLEX3.COR is extracted from the FLEX for UniFlex.
        FLEX301.COR is extracted from the MicroboxII FLEX.

    If you are on cmi_sbug version 1.1 you can boot and use the HIERCMI images, 
    but only on a straight cable.
    Because FLEX can't use the 'auto cable select' flag in de MONITOR.
