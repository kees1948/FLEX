This is the design for my floppy controller board. It supports 
5" and 8" datarate, both in signle - and double density
Sector formats 128, 256, 512 and 1024 bytes per sector.

FLEX (r) uses 256 byte/sector

The photo's show the first version, the wires do not longer apply
for the published design files.

For the posted gerber file, the floppy connectors are on top of the board.


Note:
The design file 09FLPF_210622.zip in the 

https://github.com/kees1948/UniFLEX/Hardware/CPU09GPP/09FLP

folder has the connectors at the solderside of the board.
The cut-out in the CPU09FLX boards allows for the connectors to be used
that way.
