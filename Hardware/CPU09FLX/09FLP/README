This is the design for my floppy controller board. It supports 
5" and 8" datarate, both in signle - and double density
Sector formats 128, 256, 512 and 1024 bytes per sector.

FLEX (r) uses 256 byte/sector


The photo's show the first version, the wires do not longer apply
for the published design files.
