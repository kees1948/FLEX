	PRINTER - TEST FILM QUALITY


The OHP films have 1 side for the INKJET printer
and 1 side for the LASER printer.

If you don't know witch side to use, breathe on the film
the side that fogs up is the print side for the laser printer
the side that does not fog up is the print side for the inkjet printer.
The film must have a lower temperature than the environment for this, 
hold the film in the freezer for a few seconds.
