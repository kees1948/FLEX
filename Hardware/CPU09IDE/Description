CPU09IDE for CPU09CMI

Provides:
* PIO mode
* can serve SD/CF adaptor

Description:
The CPU09IDE card serves as a PIO driven interface for the CPU09CMI system with a SD disk. 4 22V10 GAL's serve as glue logic.
It has a 40 pin connector that directly interfaces to the disk drive. The memory map of the card is 32 bytes of which the first 16
correspond to the 8 registers that an IDE/PATA disk exposes. The access is 16 bits, but in PIO mode the upper 8 bits are discarded.
The upper 16 bytes hold the 16 bit address register, the extended address and control register and a status register. 
The card format is Eurocard (160x100mm) and has a DIN41612 a-c connector.

2019-10-14: populated and tested the board (rev 1.0), found 2 incorrect things. 
1) the text irq and firq at the jumper location are swapped. For correct operation the jumper should sit on 'firq' (= irq).
2) due to a labeling error on a pin a connection is missing, a wire between pin 6 of G4 to pin 15 of G3. This is easy to
apply.

I will place rev 1.0.1 soon where these things are corrected.

So with the correction's the board works as expected.

A short word about the jumpers. The interrupt jumper should be in the position as on the photo.
The jumpers A/B/C determine the board base address. With all jumpers placed the address is $XX00. As the address size of
the board is $20 we can place an IDE board at addresses XX00/XX20/XX40/XX60/XX80/XXA0/XXC0/XXE0. 
FLEX, use DIV6 - F180.

I have ordered a reviewed design of the IDE board. When it arrives I will test it well and when found OK
I will place the designfiles here with the modified GAL patterns too. I'll keep you posted!

The board works very nice. It provides better address decoding and also access to the CS3FX- registers.
I added two LED's, one for DMA and one for IOP access. This version has all the known patches before this date 
included.
