                         Use of the CMIxxCPU with 2 x 4Kbyte ROM.
                               Selection with RA1 jumper J5.


See cpuxxcmi_memmap_4K_rom.pdf for the memory map.

Provides:
Choice for processor: MC68B02 or MC68B09 (HD63C09)@ 2..4MHz busclocks
56 KByte of contineous RAM 0000...DFFF
Decoded IO space           E000...E3FF
Extra 3KByte RAM           E400...EFFF
4K ROM                     F000...FFFF
ACIA local console port    E004...E005
Baudrate generator  0K3...38K4 with 1.2288 MHz bus signal
IO decoding very simular (but not identical) to CPU09MON
On board user/system state hardware with LED
BUS input that disables on-board addressing, allows for external boards

                         *** FLEX ***

This FLEX is a modified cmi_io4B.t version and is located on the disk:
                 cmi4Krom.DSDD77-8.IMA
It also contains a working IDE tool set, FLEXIDE.sys and FLEXFLP.SYS 

All software set for:
                     FDC = $E100
                     IDE = $E180
                    ACIA = $E004
                   cable = $E7EE
                RAM card = $EC00
        Read/Write Track = $F000
                 Monitor = $F800

FLEX disk driver:
     a part is on $E400 after the IO's.
    
Modified FLEX software:
         BOOTLOADER
         IO/Disk drivers
         FORMAT5.CMD
         FORMAT8.CMD
         BOOTON.CMD
         CMISTEP.CMD
         IDEFMT.CMD
         FDRIVES.CMD
         PLIST.CMD
         CMILINK.CMD

This FLEX version was created to test the CPU09CMI 4K ROM card.
The 4K ROM makes other operating systems possible, 
perhaps OS9 level 1.
         
Works at all speeds, but tested with 16MHz GAL modification.

13-06-2024 Update GAL's for extra RAM to use CPU9RAM card for virtual disk.
14-11-2024 Update monitor ROM with latest software version + IDE boot.
           Added modified IDE support tools.
20-11-2024 cleanup & speedup IDE calls in cmi_ide3
           The image 'cmi4Krom.DSDD77-8.IMA' contains:
               for CMISBUG5
                   FLEX3.SYS     
                   FLEXIDE.SYS needs 2 different SD cards
                   FLEXFLP.SYS

22-11-2024 cmisbug6+cmi_io6B or cmisbug6+cmi_ide6 will boot and run
           floppy images and IDE on 2K monitor version 1.6 
           and 4K monitor version 4.6 without reassembly.
           The image 'cmi4Krom.DSDD77-8.IMA' contains:
               for CMISBUG6
                   FLEX6.SYS
                   FLX6IDE.SYS needs only 1 SD card
                   FLX6FLP.sys
           It is now linked with FLX6FLP.SYS !
