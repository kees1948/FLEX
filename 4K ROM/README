                         Use of the CMIxxCPU with 2 x 4Kbyte ROM.
                               Selection with RA1 jumper J5.


See cpuxxcmi_memmap_4K_rom.pdf for the memory map.

Provides:
Choice for processor: MC68B02 or MC68B09 (HD63C09)@ 2..4MHz busclocks
56 KByte of contineous RAM 0000...DFFF
Decoded IO space           E000...E3FF
Extra 3KByte RAM           E400...EFFF
4K ROM                     F000...FFFF
ACIA local console port    E004...E005
Baudrate generator  0K3...38K4 with 1.2288 MHz bus signal
IO decoding very simular (but not identical) to CPU09MON
On board user/system state hardware with LED
BUS input that disables on-board addressing, allows for external boards

                    *** The modification. ***

We now need A11 on the ROM instead of the RA2 jumper J4.
    Remove jumper J4 and R12.
    Connect U8-23 to U9-25.
    Flash G1 (U13) with CMI-X_1.JED 
                    use CMI-4X_1.JED for the (12) 16 MHz card version.
    Flash U8 with cmiIOrom.bin and you can still BOOT and run FLEX.

                         *** FLEX ***

This FLEX is a modified cmi_io4B.t version and is located on the disk:
                 cmi4Krom.DSDD77-8.IMA

All software set for:
                     FDC = $E100
                    ACIA = $E004
                   cable = $E7EE
        Read/Write Track = $F000
                 Monitor = $F800

FLEX disk driver:
     a part is on $E400,
     Read and Write track are set in the ROM at $F000.

Modified FLEX software:
         BOOTLOADER
         IO/Disk driver
         FORMAT5.CMD
         FORMAT8.CMD
         BOOTON.CMD
         CMISTEP.CMD

This FLEX version was created to test the CPU09CMI 4K ROM card.
The 4K ROM makes other operating systems possible, 
perhaps OS9 level 1.
         
Works at all speeds, but tested with 16MHz GAL modification.

13-06-2024 update GAL's for extra RAM to use CPU9RAM card for virtual disk.
