The drivers are split in parts.
  $DE00 - $DFFF < diskdriver part-1
  $E400 - $E4FF < diskdriver part-2
  $E500 - $E5FF < Floppy read/write part
  $E600 - $E6FF < IDE driver part

The SD card needs a new bootloader.
You can use DPACH to put BOOTSECT.HEX on sector 0
or format the SD card with IDEFMT version 6.0 



Note:
     The drivers will work on  CMISBUG5 and CMISBUG6
