Using floppy disk drives

Very old 3.5" drives maybe have a DC/RDY jumper and 
DS0, DS1, DS2, DS3 jumper choice.
Later models are fixed DC and only have DS0 and DS1 jumper selection, 
some even just DS1.


However, for the FDC we need a Ready signal on pin 34.
So I made two circuits to put Ready on pin 34.

On some old 5" floppy drives pin-34 is not connected at all.

These circuits are also usable on 5" drives.

If the drive does not have a Disk Load Switch, use the index pulse circuit.


SWTPC generated ready on the FDC with a timer triggered by a /cs or index pulse 
on the 8" DMFA controllers they started using pin-22 of the drive.
