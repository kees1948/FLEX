Using 5.25" PC floppy disk drives



For the FDC we need a Ready signal on pin 34.
Most 5.25" PC drives have a jumper for this.


1:
The Mitsubishi MF504C-318BUG did not work with any jumper setting.
So I removed all the jumpers and put the following back: MM, SR, SS, DS1.
Remove the resistor array when you put it back,
the common pin will be in the middle.
After a year it finally started working.
I used a 10 year old never used HD floppy and a 45 year old used DD floppy.
The HD floppy is 100% perfect and the DD floppy has 1 bad sector.


2:
While the Mitsubishi MF504C-318BUG had too many jumpers, 
the TEAC FD-55GFR-149U had far too few.
After placing jumpers on I, IS, RY and D1 the drive worked with DD and HD floppies.
The DD floppy is 100% perfect and the HD floppy has 3 bad sector. 


3:
The old Pertec has no diskload switch and pin-34 is not connected 
so I have to use the 3.5" index pulse circuit.
The drive can format but not read, possibly faulty read data circuit,
need to check that out.
JIT the 100uH coil L1 in the uA733 12V line seems defect.





Note.
	Always use the same floppy disks.
	Performed the format and disk test.
	Copy FLEX on it and BOOT from them.
