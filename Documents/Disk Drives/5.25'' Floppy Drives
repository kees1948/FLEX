Using 5.25" PC floppy disk drives



For the FDC we need a Ready signal on pin 34.
Most 5.25" PC drives have a jumper for this.



The Mitsubishi MF504C-318BUG did not work with any jumper setting.
So I removed all the jumpers and put the following back: MM, SR, SS, DS1.
Remove the resistor array when you put it back,
the common pin will be in the middle.
After a year it finally started working.
I used a 10 year old never used HD floppy and a 45 year old used DD floppy.
The HD floppy is 100% perfect and the DD floppy has 1 bad sector.



The old Pertec has no diskload switch and pin-34 is not connected 
so I have to use the 3.5" index pulse circuit.
