Using 3.5" floppy disk drives

Very old 3.5" drives maybe have a DC/RDY jumper and DS0, DS1, DS2, DS3 jumper choice.
Later models are fixed DC and only have DS0 and DS1 jumper selection, some even just DS1.


However, for the FDC we need a Ready signal on pin 34.
So I made two circuits to put Ready on pin 34.
Since there is not much space in the 3.5" drive, two circuits have been created with four print layouts.
Took advantage of what I had in stock, sorry used also SMD parts.

The circuits are also usable on 5" drives.
If the drive does not have a Disk Load Switch, use the index pulse circuit.

It has been tested with the following DC-only drives:
	Epson SMD-340
	Sony MPF420
	Teac FD-235HF 218U

The schematics and print construction as well as adjustment and installation are present in attached files.

All 3 drives have been tested with 3.5" DD Diskettes formatted with format5 and newdisk5 as being 5" 
and with 3.5" HD Diskettes formatted with format8 and newdisk8 as being 8".





Note:
	Since the track-0 sensor is on the control board, never unscrew this board!
	Track-0 adjustment is done by sliding this board.
